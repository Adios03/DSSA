Data Scraping and Sentiment Analysis

To extract data and to perform sentiment analysis upon data.
In these Project, I have tried to extract data from random website using Beautiful Soup, Requests modules in python. On the extracted data I have implemented the Sentiment Analysis using the Natural language toolkit (NLTK Module in python) to compute variables.
This is my industry project.
